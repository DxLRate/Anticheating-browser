## Instruction for usage
- for prototype purpose I have implemented the functionalities of this project on one of my deployed project 'https://www.car-rental-app-c2b4f.web.app'. But all the features can be implemented on any specific URL by just changing 'matches' parameter under 'content_scripts' in manifest.json and adjusting some changes in contentscript.  
- For demo purpose I have set the full screen mode to 'f' key but it can be set to click of start test button. 
- If you click on 'details' of first car item window will exit from full screen mode.
- If you try to switch applications or tabs you will get alert warning popup.
- Also if more than one tabs are opened, you will again get warning popup.
