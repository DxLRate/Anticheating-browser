## Instruction for usage
- for prototype purpose I have implemented this project on one of my projects 'https://www.car-rental-app-c2b4f.web.app'. But you can can implement all the features on any specific URL by just changing 'matches' parameter under 'content_scripts' in manifest.json.  
- If you click on 'details' of first car item window will go on full screen mode.
- If you try to switch applications or tabs you will get alert warning popup.
- Also if you open more than one tabs you will again get warning popup.
